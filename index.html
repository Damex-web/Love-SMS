            <h1>My Love,</h1>
        <div class="content-items">
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #ffe6e6; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    I don’t even know where to start, Because loving you turned my
                    life into a love song. You're my sunrise and my moonlight, My
                    quiet calm and my loudest joy. Every heartbeat I have knows your
                    name by heart.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #fff0e0; color: #260505;">
                <p class="right">
                    Your smile feels like a warm fireplace on rainy day.
                    I didn’t believe in soulmates until your laugh proved me wrong.
                    You make Tuesdays feel like birthdays and Mondays like magic.
                    Every little moment with you feels like winning the lottery.
                    I could fall for you every day and still crave the next fall.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #e0f7ff; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    You’re not just part of my story you are the whole damn novel.
                    You're the plot twist I never saw coming but always needed.
                    Even your silence plays like music in my soul.
                    Being near you is like breathing effortless, vital, eternal.
                    I see entire galaxies in your eyes, and I want to explore them all.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #e0fff4; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    Sometimes, I can’t even find the words to explain this love.
                    But even my quietest days scream your name inside me.
                    You healed parts of me I didn’t know were broken.
                    You made my cracks glow instead of hide.
                    You are my bravery, my balance, my favorite heartbeat.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #f0e6ff; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    You show me love isn’t loud to be powerful.
                    Your kindness has more weight than a million roses.
                    Even on your off days, you shine brighter than anyone else.
                    I don’t want a fairy tale I want us, just as we are.
                    Perfectly imperfect and honestly beautiful.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #fffde0; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    Even your flaws? I adore them like constellations.
                    I didn’t stumble upon you I recognized you.
                    Like we’ve met in a thousand dreams before this one.
                    You are my favorite hello and my most stubborn goodbye.
                    Even when you’re quiet, I hear everything you feel.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #ffdce0; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    Your mind is a wonderland I never want to leave.
                    Your ideas blaze like fire, and your heart hums like calm waters.
                    You’re a perfect storm and a gentle sky, all at once.
                    The kind of beauty that doesn’t fade it evolves.
                    I want to know every version of you past, present, becoming.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #dceeff; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    You are my today, my tomorrow, my forever-after.
                    When I’m with you, I feel more like myself.
                    Your love makes me rise, grow, believe again.
                    Even your stillness feels like truth wrapped in comfort.
                    You’re the rhythm I never knew I needed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #ffd9d4; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    With you, love isn’t falling it’s flying.
                    I want a home where your laughter echoes in every room.
                    A future where our dreams hold hands and run wild.
                    Every storm we face, I want to face next to you.
                    Your hand in mine is all the magic I’ll ever need.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #e6ffe6; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    You are the wish I made before I knew I was wishing.
                    You are every "what if" turned into "thank God it’s real."
                    Even in silence, you bring warmth to my bones.
                    You make my world glow in ways I never imagined.
                    When we’re apart, you still live in every breath I take.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #ffe5b4; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    You’ve shown me that love isn’t in the fireworks
                    It’s in the quiet glances, the unexpected hugs, the knowing smiles.
                    You turn ordinary days into memories worth keeping.
                    I’d walk through storms, climb mountains, and defy time for you.
                    Every universe I exist in I’d still choose you.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #e6e6ff; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    If love was a language, your name would be every word.
                    I want to be the one who reminds you daily:
                    You are powerful, lovable, extraordinary beyond belief.
                    You're not a destination you're the entire adventure.
                    And I want to walk every mile with you, heart to heart.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #f7e7ce; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    Even when I have no words left, this remains true:
                    I love you. With every part of me.
                    In the loud moments and the quiet ones, in all seasons.
                    I’ll love you when it’s easy, and love you harder when it’s not.
                    Forever is the only plan I have for us.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="itmes" style="background-color: #fff9e6; color: #260505;">
                <p>
                    And every single day, in every single way 
                    I will choose you again and again.
                    Through sunshine and thunder, in chaos and calm.
                    You are not just my love 
                    You are my once-in-a-lifetime, and I’ll never let go.
